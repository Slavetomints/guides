      # Basic Scanning

      Alrighty! Now that we've [checked our scope](https://slavetomints.github.io/guides/guides/network-security/nmap/list-scans.html), its time to check to see what on the network is active. For this we'll be using `198.162.0.0/24` for demonstration purposes.
      
      ```

      Wow! That's a lot of information! So we now need to figure out what is what. Some of it is pretty simple, such as `192.160.0.200`. We know from the MAC Address that it is an Apple device, probably an iPhone or an iPad. What else can we figure out from this scan?
      
      Another point of interest is the device at `192.168.0.10`, which we know is a Dell computer, but what else? Well, it's likely that its a Windows workstation due to the fact that FTP is up and running, and that port 139 is active, which is usually used for file sharing purposes for devices such as printers on a Windows machine. 
      
      So now that we've looked as some of the devices and identified them, it's your turn to identify the other devices and figure out their roles in the network.
