      # Basic Usage

      In order to use [John the Ripper](https://slavetomints.github.io/guides/guides/vocabulary.html#john-the-ripper), you first need to have it installed. If you do not have it installed yet, please checkout the [installation guide](https://slavetomints.github.io/guides/guides/password-cracking/john-the-ripper/installation/installation.html).
      
      For the most basic usage of John the Ripper, all you need is a file full of hashed passwords, which we'll call `hashes.txt`. The contents of `hashes.txt` should look something similar to this:
      
      ```
      
      ┌─[slavetomints@parrot]─[~]
      └──╼ $cat hashes.txt
      joe:d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4
      john:e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
      admin:5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
      jane:9686c6f3173c9d463fe3a78da4f3616c
      superuser:0d107d09f5bbe40cade3de5c71e9e9b7
      
      ```
      
      Now you can call `john hashes.txt` on the command line and watch the fireworks! Truly a [Master H4X0r](https://www.reddit.com/r/masterhacker/) .
      
      ```

      ```
      
      Well, maybe not. See, you cant just throw passwords at john. While it might work for super super common passwords and small passwords, it wont work for much else. So we need to upgrade our command. The first thing we'll introduce is the `--format=` flag.
      
      ## ----format
      
      This flag allows you to specify the format of the hashes at hand. John will try its best to figure it for you but like in the example above, it can also mimic kernel panic. If you don't know what format the hashes are in, that's okay! We can use `hashid` to do that. If you don't know how to use that tool, check out [this guide](https://slavetomints.github.io/guides/guides/password-cracking/hashid.html) where we go over it.
      
      So, now that we know the format of the hashes, its important to use the correct syntax for it. If we have an [MD5](https://slavetomints.github.io/guides/guides/vocabulary.html#md5) hash, we need to specify `--format=Raw-MD5` instead of simply using `--format=md5`. You can find all the formats using the command `john --list=formats`
      
      ## ----wordlist
      
      So lets say you want to use a specific curated wordlist for your attack. How do you specify it? This is where the `--wordlist` flag is helpful. If your wordlist such as `rockyou.txt` is in `/usr/share/wordlists/` you'll have to append `--wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/your-wordlist-here` But let's say your have a file in your current directory that you want to use.  Do you need to spell out the whole path? Thankfully no, all you need to do is call it relative to where you are.
      
      ## Putting it together
      
      Now that we know all about the basic usage of `John the Ripper`, lets take another crack at those passwords from earlier. We know now that the format of the passwords is just simply raw MD5, and that they're likely in `rockyou.txt` due to their simplicity and its extensive collection. 
      
      ```
      
      ┌─[slavetomints@parrot]─[~]
